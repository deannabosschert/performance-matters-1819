### To Do
[ ] Render genreOverzicht pages
[ ] Combine genreFilters in one function

[ ] Write script for extracting data from the API and updating the already existing JSON file
[ ] Create button for refreshing the JSON data file


### Description
This is a web-app based on the API of the OBA (Openbare Bibliotheek Amsterdam; public library of Amsterdam).
Children aged 0-12 can pick out books to read via a visual representation of the available genres as they often pick out books already only based on association with the cover as well.
